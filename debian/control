Description: Kanux desktop icon manager
 This package provides the Kanux graphical desktop facade.
 It presents the Kanux background along with all Kano-Make icons organized
 so you can follow all learning experience apps: Make Pong, Minecraft, Video
 and surf the rest of system applications directly from the desktop
