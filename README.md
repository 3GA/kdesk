## Kano Desktop manager - kdesk


Kano Desktop Manager, aka *kdesk*, is a lightweight desktop manager optimized for Kano OS and other Debian-based systems, including the desktop background image, icons, and egl screensaver. 

Weâ€™ve created the utility from scratch, with inspiration taken from other desktop managers, especially [idesk](https://github.com/neagix/idesk) and [vdesk](http://xvnkb.sourceforge.net/?menu=vdesk&lang=en).

Features: 
* optimized connection with the notify library for Openbox window manager and others, so the hourglass start-up feature works seamlessly
* 100% customizable background, icons, screensaver
* efficient screensaver with low CPU usage
